# titanic-machine-learning

### Introduction

Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning problem. The (somewhat morbid) task is to predict if a passenger will survive given a number attributes that passenger. 

"""titanic-ml.py""" reads in """train.csv""" which contains a list of passengers their attributes (e.g. Age, Gender, Cabin type, etc) and if they survived. This data is then used to train a number classification algorithms and build models that are used to predict survival of each passenger listed in """test.csv""".

### Algorithms tested

A number of the classification algorithms found in Python's """sci-kit-learn""" library were used, including:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines
k-Nearest Neighbor
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Perceptron
Stochastic Gradient Descent
Random Forest

A number of
